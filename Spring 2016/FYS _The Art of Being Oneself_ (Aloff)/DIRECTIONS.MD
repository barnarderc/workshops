Here are some resources and tips that may be of use in completing the "Montaigne Look-it-up" assignment for this course:
1.	Create a [Tiki-Toki](http://www.tiki-toki.com/) account (it's free!).
2.	[Here](https://github.com/barnarderc/workshops/blob/master/Spring%202016/FYS%20_The%20Art%20of%20Being%20Oneself_%20(Aloff)/tiki_toki_tutorial_handout_0.pdf) is a handout with an overview of the instructions for how to input entries for the references contained within Montaigne's "On Some Verses of Virgil" essay.
3.	[Here](http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/574083/Montaigne-Essay-References/) is a link to an example timeline with entries of references contained within the first 2-3 pages of Montaigne's essay. The example timeline is password protected (password is located in the handout, which you may download by clicking the link in the previous point/#2).
