The mill began production on February 7 1856, with 17,000 spindles. Other sources mention it being the first steam cotton mill being built in Bombay. The mill ran with the supervision of British engineers and skilled cotton operatives. The success of the mill convinced Cowasjee to build a duplicate mill with more spindles alongside the Tardeo building. This was also built a few years later. Tardeo was at the outskirts at the time. The mill was built with a 5 million rupee contribution from 50 of Bombay’s leading businessmen.",
