For an introduction to GIS, you can follow along using the mapping/ArcGIS [presentation.](https://github.com/barnarderc/workshops/blob/master/Fall%202017/Sustainable%20Development/mapping_ArcGIS%20presentation.pdf)

There are three guides for the georeferencing portion of this workshop (QGIS guides, but will be demonstrated with ArcMap):
Access the first guide [here.](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/04_MakingData01.md)
Access the second guide [here.](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/05_MakingData02.md)
Access the third guide [here.](https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/MappingForTheUrbanHumanities/blob/master/Tutorials/06_MakingData03.md)

Here is a [guide](https://github.com/barnarderc/workshops/blob/master/Fall%202017/Sustainable%20Development/arcmap_georeferencing_guide.pdf) for ArcGIS using an alternative example (the materials that the guide refers to can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tdclaagbj154i67/Architecture_MexicoGIS.zip?dl=0)).

For the second portion of this workshop (joining tabular data to a shapefile), please access the data [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8tlc5srtalz8qfk/Intro_to_GIS_Workshop_Data.zip?dl=0)

You can download the handout with step-by-step notes from this portion of the workshop [here.](https://github.com/barnarderc/workshops/blob/master/Fall%202017/Sustainable%20Development/joining_tabular_data_step_by_step.pdf)
